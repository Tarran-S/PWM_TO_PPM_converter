PWM
PWM is a method of encoding analog information into a digital signal by varying the width of pulses in a periodic waveform.In PWM, the amplitude of the signal remains constant, but the width of the pulses changes in proportion to the amplitude of the analog signal being encoded.PWM is commonly used in applications such as controlling the speed of motors, generating analog signals, and in digital communication systems.

PPM
PPM is a method of encoding analog information into a digital signal by varying the position of individual pulses in a periodic waveform.In PPM, the width and amplitude of the pulses remain constant, but the position of the pulses within the waveform varies according to the amplitude of the analog signal.PPM is often used in applications such as radio control systems, where it is used to encode control signals for remote-controlled vehicles and aircraft.

Converting PWM to PPM signals can offer advantages in terms of synchronization, noise immunity, compatibility, reduced complexity, and interference rejection, making it a preferred choice in certain applications, especially in radio control systems and other communication systems.
